# LED Simulator

A dynamic LED light simulator that creates mesmerizing patterns using JavaScript and HTML. This project simulates a custom number of LED lights that can display various animations including a smoldering effect and snake-like patterns.

## Features

- Smooth color transitions between multiple shades
- Snake-like animations that travel across the LED strip
- Customizable timing and color patterns
- Responsive design that adapts to screen width

## Technical Details

The simulator uses vanilla JavaScript and HTML to create a grid of div elements that act as individual LEDs. Each LED can be controlled independently, allowing for complex animation patterns.

## Animations

- Smolder Effect: Creates a gradual fade between 10 different shades
- Snake Pattern: Dual-colored snake-like movement across the LED strip

## Setup

Simply open the HTML file in a modern web browser. No additional dependencies required.
